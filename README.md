# decaf-ts/for-http

A lightweight HTTP adapter layer for decaf-ts that enables CRUD-style repositories and services over REST APIs. It defines a generic HttpAdapter with concrete implementations (e.g., Axios), a RestService for simple model-centric operations, and a RestRepository when you need repository decoration logic before submitting to the backend. Includes minimal types for configuration and request flags.

# decaf-ts/for-http — Detailed Description

This package provides a small, focused HTTP integration for decaf-ts. It introduces a generic HttpAdapter abstraction that maps REST semantics (create/read/update/delete and bulk variants) onto decaf-ts repositories and services, plus minimal configuration and flags. A ready-to-use Axios adapter is included.

Core goals
- Keep HTTP concerns decoupled from models and repositories.
- Provide a consistent CRUD surface over REST endpoints.
- Allow custom clients (via subclassing HttpAdapter) while shipping an Axios implementation.
- Offer simple configuration (protocol/host) and request-scoped headers via flags/context.

Key building blocks
- HttpConfig: A minimal connection config with protocol and host.
- HttpFlags: Extends RepositoryFlags to include optional HTTP headers.
- HttpAdapter<Y, CON, Q, F, C>:
  - Extends the core Adapter to focus on HTTP.
  - Adds default flags() with headers support.
  - Provides URL building (protected url()) and error parsing (parseError()).
  - Declares abstract request(), create(), read(), update(), delete().
  - Declares optional/unsupported-by-default raw(), Sequence(), Statement(), parseCondition() that concrete adapters may implement if needed.
  - repository() returns RestService as the default repository/service implementation for this adapter type.
- RestService<M, Q, A, F, C>:
  - Lightweight, model-centric service that delegates to the HttpAdapter for CRUD and bulk operations.
  - Converts between model instances and plain records using adapter.prepare() and adapter.revert().
  - Manages a list of observers (observe/unObserve/updateObservers) that can be refreshed after changes.
- RestRepository<M, Q, A, F, C>:
  - A Repository that works with an HttpAdapter; use it if you need decaf-ts repository decoration/logic before sending to the backend.
  - Not the default repository for the HTTP adapter (that role is fulfilled by RestService); intended for cases where repository lifecycle logic matters.
- AxiosHttpAdapter:
  - Concrete implementation of HttpAdapter built on Axios.
  - Implements request and CRUD operations using Axios.request/get/post/put/delete.
  - Uses HttpConfig for base URL construction and inherits header flag behavior.

Flow overview
1. Instantiate a concrete adapter (e.g., AxiosHttpAdapter) with an HttpConfig.
2. Get a repository/service for a given model (the default is RestService via adapter.getRepository(), or instantiate RestService/RestRepository directly).
3. Call CRUD methods (create/read/update/delete) or their bulk equivalents (createAll/readAll/updateAll/deleteAll) on the service or repository. The service:
   - Derives the table/collection name from the model’s decaf-ts metadata.
   - Uses adapter.prepare() to serialize the model and extract its ID.
   - Invokes the adapter’s HTTP methods.
   - Uses adapter.revert() to rehydrate responses back into model instances.
4. Optionally provide HttpFlags (e.g., headers) in the Context to influence requests.

URL building and error handling
- HttpAdapter.url() builds URLs as `${protocol}://${host}/${tableName}` and appends encoded query parameters when provided, ensuring spaces are encoded as %20.
- HttpAdapter.parseError() currently returns the error unchanged (as BaseError) but is intended to be overridden/extended by concrete adapters to normalize HTTP/client errors.

Bulk operations
- RestService implements createAll, readAll, updateAll, deleteAll. These delegate to similarly named adapter methods (which are expected to exist on the base Adapter implementation from @decaf-ts/core), allowing efficient batched operations where supported by the backend.

Unsupported APIs by default
- Some persistence APIs from the core (raw, Sequence, Statement, parseCondition) are not meaningful out of the box for a generic HTTP adapter, so HttpAdapter throws UnsupportedError for them. Concrete adapters targeting specific backends can choose to implement these.

When to use RestService vs RestRepository
- Use RestService by default for straightforward CRUD over REST endpoints.
- Use RestRepository if you need repository-level decoration logic (e.g., hooks, rules) to run on your models before hitting the HTTP layer.

Extending with another HTTP client
- Subclass HttpAdapter and implement request(), create(), read(), update(), delete().
- Override parseError() to translate client-specific errors to your app’s BaseError.
- Optionally implement raw(), Sequence(), Statement(), parseCondition() if your backend/client supports those features.


# How to Use decaf-ts/for-http

Below are concise, non-repeating examples demonstrating how to use each public element of this library. All code samples are valid TypeScript.

Note: Examples assume your models are decorated with decaf-ts metadata (e.g., table names and primary keys) through @decaf-ts/decorator-validation and @decaf-ts/db-decorators. For brevity, model decoration details are omitted.

## Types: HttpConfig and HttpFlags

Description: Define the basic connection configuration and optional per-request headers.

```ts
import { HttpConfig, HttpFlags } from "@decaf-ts/for-http";

const config: HttpConfig = {
  protocol: "https",
  host: "api.example.com",
};

// You can pass headers via flags (typically through a Context)
const flags: HttpFlags = {
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer <token>",
  },
};
```

## Adapter: AxiosHttpAdapter

Description: Ready-to-use HTTP adapter based on Axios. Use it to interact with REST endpoints.

```ts
import { AxiosHttpAdapter } from "@decaf-ts/for-http/axios";
import { HttpConfig } from "@decaf-ts/for-http";

const config: HttpConfig = { protocol: "https", host: "api.example.com" };
const adapter = new AxiosHttpAdapter(config);
```

## Service: RestService

Description: Lightweight, model-centric service that delegates CRUD and bulk operations to the adapter.

```ts
import { RestService } from "@decaf-ts/for-http";
import { AxiosHttpAdapter } from "@decaf-ts/for-http/axios";
import { HttpConfig } from "@decaf-ts/for-http";

// Example model (assumes proper decaf-ts decorations elsewhere)
class User {
  id!: string;
  name!: string;
}

const config: HttpConfig = { protocol: "https", host: "api.example.com" };
const adapter = new AxiosHttpAdapter(config);

// Create a service bound to the User model
const users = new RestService<User, any, typeof adapter>(adapter, User);

// Create
const created = await users.create({ id: "u1", name: "Alice" } as User);

// Read
const found = await users.read("u1");

// Update
const updated = await users.update({ id: "u1", name: "Alice Cooper" } as User);

// Delete
const removed = await users.delete("u1");

// Bulk create
const many = await users.createAll([
  { id: "u2", name: "Bob" } as User,
  { id: "u3", name: "Carol" } as User,
]);

// Bulk read
const foundMany = await users.readAll(["u2", "u3"]);

// Bulk update
const updatedMany = await users.updateAll([
  { id: "u2", name: "Bobby" } as User,
  { id: "u3", name: "Caroline" } as User,
]);

// Bulk delete
const removedMany = await users.deleteAll(["u2", "u3"]);
```

## Repository: RestRepository

Description: Use this when you need decaf-ts "repository" decoration logic to run before hitting the HTTP backend.

```ts
import { RestRepository } from "@decaf-ts/for-http";
import { AxiosHttpAdapter } from "@decaf-ts/for-http/axios";
import { HttpConfig } from "@decaf-ts/for-http";

class Product {
  id!: number;
  title!: string;
}

const cfg: HttpConfig = { protocol: "https", host: "store.example.com" };
const http = new AxiosHttpAdapter(cfg);

// Create a repository for Product
const products = new RestRepository<Product, any, typeof http>(http, Product);

// Typical repository interactions
const p = await products.findById(101);
// ... other repository APIs as provided by @decaf-ts/core Repository
```

## Passing headers via flags/context

Description: Supply headers for a specific operation using HttpFlags. These are typically carried inside a Context from @decaf-ts/db-decorators.

```ts
import { Context } from "@decaf-ts/db-decorators";
import { OperationKeys } from "@decaf-ts/db-decorators";
import { AxiosHttpAdapter, AxiosFlags } from "@decaf-ts/for-http/axios";
import { RestService } from "@decaf-ts/for-http";

class User { id!: string; name!: string; }

const adapter = new AxiosHttpAdapter({ protocol: "https", host: "api.example.com" });
const users = new RestService<User, any, typeof adapter>(adapter, User);

// Generate flags for a READ operation (adds an empty headers obj you can override)
const flags = adapter.flags<User>(OperationKeys.READ, User, { headers: { Authorization: "Bearer <token>" } });

// Place flags into a context (shape depends on @decaf-ts/db-decorators; we cast here for example purposes)
const ctx = { flags } as unknown as Context<AxiosFlags>;

// Many decaf-ts operations accept an optional context/flags as the last argument
const user = await users.read("u1", ctx);
```

## Subclassing: Custom HttpAdapter

Description: Implement a custom adapter for a different HTTP client. You must implement request and CRUD methods at minimum.

```ts
import { HttpAdapter, HttpConfig, HttpFlags } from "@decaf-ts/for-http";
import { Context } from "@decaf-ts/db-decorators";

// Hypothetical client types
type MyClient = { request: <T>(config: any) => Promise<T>; get: <T>(url: string) => Promise<T>; post: <T>(url: string, body: any) => Promise<T>; put: <T>(url: string, body: any) => Promise<T>; delete: <T>(url: string) => Promise<T>; };

type MyRequestConfig = { url: string; method: "GET"|"POST"|"PUT"|"DELETE"; data?: any; headers?: Record<string,string>; };

type MyFlags = HttpFlags;

type MyContext = Context<MyFlags>;

class MyHttpAdapter extends HttpAdapter<HttpConfig, MyClient, MyRequestConfig, MyFlags, MyContext> {
  constructor(config: HttpConfig, alias?: string) { super(config, "my-client", alias); }

  protected override getClient(): MyClient {
    // create and return your HTTP client instance
    return {
      request: async <T>(c: any) => ({} as T),
      get: async <T>(url: string) => ({} as T),
      post: async <T>(url: string, body: any) => ({} as T),
      put: async <T>(url: string, body: any) => ({} as T),
      delete: async <T>(url: string) => ({} as T),
    };
  }

  override async request<V>(details: MyRequestConfig): Promise<V> {
    // bridge to your client’s request API
    return this.client.request<V>(details);
  }

  async create(table: string, id: string|number, model: Record<string, any>): Promise<Record<string, any>> {
    const url = this.url(table);
    return this.client.post(url, model);
  }

  async read(table: string, id: string|number|bigint): Promise<Record<string, any>> {
    const url = this.url(table, { id: id as string|number });
    return this.client.get(url);
  }

  async update(table: string, id: string|number, model: Record<string, any>): Promise<Record<string, any>> {
    const url = this.url(table);
    return this.client.put(url, model);
  }

  async delete(table: string, id: string|number|bigint): Promise<Record<string, any>> {
    const url = this.url(table, { id: id as string|number });
    return this.client.delete(url);
  }

  // Optionally override parseError(err) to normalize client-specific errors
}
```

## Constants and Types (axios)

Description: Utilities specific to the Axios implementation.

```ts
import { AxiosFlavour, AxiosFlags } from "@decaf-ts/for-http/axios";

// AxiosFlavour is the adapter flavour identifier string: "axios"
console.log(AxiosFlavour);

// AxiosFlags is a type alias of HttpFlags; useful for contexts with Axios
const f: AxiosFlags = { headers: { "X-Trace": "1" } };
```
