# decaf-ts/for-http

A lightweight HTTP adapter layer for decaf-ts that enables CRUD-style repositories and services over REST APIs. It defines a generic HttpAdapter with concrete implementations (e.g., Axios), a RestService for simple model-centric operations, and a RestRepository when you need repository decoration logic before submitting to the backend. Includes minimal types for configuration and request flags.
