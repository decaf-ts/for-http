### Description

The `@decaf-ts/for-http` library provides a robust and type-safe solution for interacting with REST APIs in TypeScript applications. Built on top of the core Decaf framework, it implements the repository pattern to offer a clean and consistent interface for HTTP operations.

#### Architecture

The library is structured around several key components:

1. **HTTP Adapter**: The `HttpAdapter` class serves as the foundation, providing an abstract interface for HTTP operations. It handles URL construction, error parsing, and implements the adapter pattern to work with different HTTP clients.

2. **Axios Implementation**: The library includes a concrete implementation of the HTTP adapter using Axios (`AxiosHttpAdapter`), demonstrating how to integrate with popular HTTP clients.

3. **Repository Pattern**: The `RestRepository` class extends the core Repository class to provide a high-level interface for CRUD operations on REST resources. It works with model classes and handles the mapping between your domain models and API endpoints.

4. **Service Layer**: The `RestService` class offers both individual and bulk CRUD operations, with support for the observer pattern to notify subscribers of changes.

5. **Type Definitions**: Comprehensive type definitions ensure type safety throughout your API interactions, with interfaces like `HttpFlags` and `HttpConfig` providing configuration options.

#### Key Features

- **Type Safety**: Leverages TypeScript's type system to ensure API interactions are type-safe
- **Repository Pattern**: Implements the repository pattern for clean separation of concerns
- **CRUD Operations**: Provides standard create, read, update, and delete operations
- **Bulk Operations**: Supports bulk operations for efficient handling of multiple resources
- **Extensibility**: Designed to be extended with different HTTP client implementations
- **Error Handling**: Includes robust error handling and parsing
- **Observer Pattern**: Implements the observer pattern for reactive programming

This library is ideal for applications that need to interact with REST APIs in a structured, type-safe manner, particularly those already using the Decaf framework.
